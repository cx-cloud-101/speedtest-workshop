===================================================
_In this section we'll analyze the speedtests stored in Big Query and create a report using [Data Studio](https://datastudio.google.com/)._

Connecting to Big Query
-----------------------
Create connection, name properties and more.

Creating a Speedtest Report
---------------------------
Current basic example of a [speedtest report](https://datastudio.google.com/open/1w0zwpAn4eXDWgEvk_LXP6crbrmUnz5T5).

Sharing your report
-------------------
One of the best things about Data Studio, is how easy it's to share your reports.

What now?

Congratulations! You have just made a complete speedtest solution on GCP.

From here you can choose to enhance your solution in a couple of different ways:
* Tired of running the logger manually? [Use Pub-Sub to trigger it!](triggering-speedtests)
* Want to automate build and deploy of the API? [Try out GCP Cloud Build!](automate-the-api-build)
