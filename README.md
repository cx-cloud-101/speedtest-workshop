Welcome to the Cloud 101 workshop!

In this workshop you'll make your own over-engineered system for monitoring internet speed at home. You'll build a distributed system for triggering, receiving and analyzing speedtests twice. First on Azure and then on Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

If you're not already, you should really view this page at [cx-cloud-101.github.io](https://cx-cloud-101.github.io/speedtest-workshop/).
